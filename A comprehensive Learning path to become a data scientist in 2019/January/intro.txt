================================================
Statistic Example #1: Ice  Cream
A new advertisement for Ben and Jerry's ice cream introduced in late May of last year resulted in a 30% increase in ice cream sales for the following three months. Thus, the advertisement was effective.

.... Problems with this logic?

Yes

Ice cream consumtion typically increases in summer months.

thus, there is a "history effect"
================================================
Statistic Example #2: Churches and Crime
The more churches in a city, the more crime there is. thus, churches lead to crime.


.... Problems with this logic?

Yes

Increased churches and increased crime rates can be explained by larger populations.

Thus, there is a potential "third variable problem"
================================================
Statistic Example #3: Interracial Marriages
75% more interracial marriages are occurring this year than 25 year ago.
Thus, our society accepts interracial marriages.

.... Problems with this logic?

Yes

What is the rate at which marriages are occurring? are there fluctuations in the rate of interracial marriages?

Sometimes, we simply don't have the information that we need to understand the impact of statistics.
